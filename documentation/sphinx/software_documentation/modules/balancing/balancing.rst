Driver Configuration:

Structure
~~~~~~~~~

The |mod_bal| takes care of the voltage or charge equalization of the battery
cells. Balancing is deactivated by default by the switch
``BALANCING_DEFAULT_INACTIVE`` in
``embedded-software\mcu-primary\src\general\config\batterysystem_cfg.h``,
which is set to ``TRUE``, to prevent automatic start of the balancing when
|foxBMS| is used in a laboratory environment for example. The switch must be
manually set to ``FALSE`` to allow the automatic balancing and charge
equalization process.

The default balancing method is voltage-based balancing. This is set by the
switch ``BALANCING_VOLTAGE_BASED`` in
``embedded-software\mcu-primary\src\general\config\batterysystem_cfg.h``,
which is then set to ``TRUE``. A more advanced balancing method implemented in
|foxbms| is based on the SOC history balancing. As this method needs a look-up
table of the used battery cell behavior, it is not the default method. It can
be used by setting the switch ``BALANCING_VOLTAGE_BASED`` to ``TRUE``.


When the current flowing through the battery is below the limit defined by
``BS_REST_CURRENT_mA`` in
``embedded-software\mcu-primary\src\general\config\batterysystem_cfg.h``,
the |mod_bal| waits ``BS_RELAXATION_PERIOD_MS`` milliseconds before starting to
perform balancing. The waiting time is re-initialized every time the current
exceeds ``BS_REST_CURRENT_mA``.
No balancing takes place if the voltage of the cells in the battery pack goes
below ``BAL_LOWER_VOLTAGE_LIMIT_MV`` or the maximum temperature of the cells
in the pack goes above ``BAL_UPPER_TEMPERATURE_LIMIT_DEG``.


Voltage-based balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In voltage-based balancing, the |mod_bal| takes the minimum battery cell
voltage of the complete battery pack and activates balancing for all the cells
whose voltage is above the minimum + ``BAL_THRESHOLD_MV``. Once all cells have
been balanced, the threshold is set to
``BAL_THRESHOLD_MV`` + ``BAL_HYSTERESIS_MV`` to avoid an oscillating behavior
between balancing and not balancing.

In the |mod_bms|, when entering the ``STANDBY`` state, voltage-based balancing
is allowed. When entering ``PRECHARGE`` or ``ERROR``, voltage-based balancing
is not allowed.

SOC history-based balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SOC history-based balancing works as follows: at one point in time, when
no current is flowing and the cell voltages have fully relaxed (e.g., after 3
hours rest time), the voltages of all cells are measured. With a suitable SOC
versus voltage look-up table, the voltages are converted to their respective
SOCs. The SOCs are then translated to Depth-of-Discharge (DOD) using the
nominal capacity, with:

``DOD = Capacity * (1-SOC)``

The cell with the highest DOD is taken as a reference, since it is the most
discharged cell in the battery pack. Its charge difference is set to 0. For
all other cells, the charge difference is computed via:

``Charge difference(considered cell) =  DOD(reference cell) - DOD(considered cell)``

Balancing is then  switched on for all cells. Every second, for each cell, the
voltage is taken and the balancing current computed with:

``current = cell voltage / balancing resistance``

The balancing quantity:

``current * 1s``

is subtracted from the charge difference. Balancing is stays turned on until
the charge difference reaches 0.

In SOC history-based balancing, ``BS_BALANCING_RESISTANCE_OHM`` must be
defined identically to the balancing resistances soldered on the |BMS-Slave|.
When the imbalances are computed, they are set to a non-zero value to balance
each specific cell only if its cell voltage is above the minimum cell voltage
of the battery pack plus a threshold. The threshold is set in this case to
``BAL_THRESHOLD_MV`` + ``BAL_HYSTERESIS_MV``. It is not simply set to
``BAL_THRESHOLD_MV`` for compatibility reasons with the code shared with the
voltage-based balancing.

The correspondence between cell voltage and SOC must be defined by the user
depending on the specific battery cells used. Currently, it is done in the
function ``SOC_GetFromVoltage()`` in ``sox.c``. This function gets a voltage
in V and return an SOC between 0 and 1.

.. note::
    The SOC to voltage correspondence is specific to the cell used. The user
    must define the look-up table, or the SOC history-based balancing will not
    perform as expected.
